 * @description
 * @This function will first execute all testcases for each job that
 * @was parsed into the configuration. Jobs are sperate from testcases
 * @in that jobs tell Catalyst how to build the program. For each job,
 * @the output from the Makefile is redirected into a log file. The
 * @output of each job might not be necessary for the programmer to know,
 * @and so for each job that is performed, the user is notified of whether
 * @or not a job failed to compile the program, or if it succeeded. This
 * @way the user does not have to read through multiple (potentially large)
 * @log files just to see if a test failed to compile.
